====================

Unity Client

Open the Infinite World Folder in Unity
  - In Unity, open "Scene1" and click the play button to play the game. 

I've added some Photon server stuff to this. If you do a build of the project you can 
run the exe to play the game and start hosting a server.  Then you can click play in Unity
to start up a second instance of the game and join the server.  You will now see 2 characters
in the same world. It's choppy at the moment, but that's fine for now.
